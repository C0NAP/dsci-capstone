'And now,' it said as it collapsed, 'can I do anything more for
      you?'
'Just one thing; and I think that clears everything up, doesn't
      it,Jane? I wish Martha to forget about the diamond ring, and
      motherto forget about the keeper cleaning the
      windows.''It's like the "Brass Bottle",' said
      Jane.
'Yes, I'm glad we read that or I should never have thought of
      it.'
'Now,' said the Psammead faintly, 'I'm almost worn out. Is
      there anything else?'
'No; only thank you kindly for all you've done for us, and I
      hope you'll have a good long sleep, and I hope we shall see you
      again some day.'
'Is that a wish?' it said in a weak voice.
'Yes, please,' said the two girls together.
Then for the last time in this story they saw the Psammead blow
      itself out and collapse suddenly. It nodded to them, blinked its
      long snail's eyes, burrowed, and disappeared, scratching fiercely
      to the last, and the sand closed over it.
'I hope we've done right?' said Jane.
'I'm sure we have,' said Anthea. 'Come on home and tell the
      boys.'

Anthea found Cyril glooming over his paper boats, and told him.
      Jane told Robert. The two tales were only just ended when mother
      walked in, hot and dusty. She explained that as she was being
      driven into Rochester to buy the girls' autumn school-dresses the
      axle had broken, and but for the narrowness of the lane and the
      high soft hedges she would have been thrown out. As it was, she
      was not hurt, but she had had to walk home. 'And oh, my dearest
      dear chicks,' she said, 'I am simply dying for a cup of tea! Do
      run and see if the kettle boils!'
'So you see it's all right,'Jane whispered. 'She doesn't
      remember.'
'No more does Martha,' said Anthea, who had been to ask after
      the state of the kettle.
As the servants sat at their tea, Beale the gamekeeper dropped
      in. He brought the welcome news that Lady Chittenden's diamonds
      had not been lost at all. Lord Chittenden had taken them to be
      re-set and cleaned, and the maid who knew about it had gone for a
      holiday. So that was all right.
'I wonder if we ever shall see the Psammead again,' said Jane
      wistfully as they walked in the garden, while mother was putting
      the Lamb to bed.
'I'm sure we shall,' said Cyril, 'if you really wished it.'
'We've promised never to ask it for another wish,' said
      Anthea.
'I never want to,' said Robert earnestly.

They did see it again, of course, but not in this story. And it
      was not in a sand-pit either, but in a very, very, very different
      place. It was in a â€” But I must say no more.
